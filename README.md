# Rock Art Vision

Computer vision üëÅÔ∏è program for Rock Art analysis. 

## Introduction

_This program is part of my work to obtain Electronic Engineering degree._ ü§ï

Here a methodology for the organisation and analisys of rock art data from Arica y Parinacota region is being proposed. 
Workig with drawings from these artifeacts a curvature analisys is being developed for a automatic classification.
Also, manim animations are beign studied for visualization purpose during the final presentation.

## Progress
The following list is the code composition and its progress:

## Some code.
_for you to believe in my programming abilities_
### Preprocessing

Here im gonna show some functions from `imagen.py` file

We are starting with this drawing, an interpretation from a rock art.
![](images/images_readme/image_raw.png)<br />
As you can see its a really easy image to work with. If you were asking why, its because its a *binary image*, it means we are only working with one channel (array or matrix) instead of three (the case of colored image).
#### Thresholding
For us to know which should be the range of values for this kind of image, we should extract as *histogram*, something like the spectrum of this image.
```python
img = Imagen(r'C:\\...\images_raw\img.tif')
plt.hist(img.img.ravel(),256,[0,256])
plt.show
```
![](images/images_readme/hist.png)<br />
This is how we should be hable to know where to apply the threshold.
Applying 
```python
thresh = img.thresh()
plot(thresh)
```
![](images/images_readme/image_preprocessed.png)<br />

#### First moment of area 
This is a real important feature for us to positioning the object at the center of the image.
The function was coded following the next formula._<br />
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?S_x&space;=&space;A\bar{y}&space;=&space;\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}y_i&space;d&space;A_i&space;=&space;\int_{A}ydA" title="S_x = A\bar{y} = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}y_i d A_i = \int_{A}ydA" /><br />
and <br />
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?S_y&space;=&space;A\bar{x}&space;=&space;\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}x_i&space;d&space;A_i&space;=&space;\int_{A}xdA" title="S_y = A\bar{x} = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}x_i d A_i = \int_{A}xdA" /><br />

```python
fm = img.first_moment()
plot(fm)
```
![](images/images_readme/first_moment.png)<br />

#### Second momento of area.
![](images/images_readme/second_moment.png)<br />

### Segmentation.
First we define a vector of point for us to start the contour algorithm
![](images/images_readme/segmentation_init.png)<br />

### Greedy alhorithm.

In this section the a greedy approach is used for the control points to fit the contour of the images. For us to do that, first we defined a energy image, gived by the Blurred Gradient Magnitude Squared.<br />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?||\Delta&space;n_{\sigma}*I||^{2}" title="||\Delta n_{\sigma}*I||^{2}" /><br />
![](images/images_readme/blurgrad.png)<br />

The algorithm is supossed to search for the maximum of the evergy funtion. In a mathematics language:<br />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\equiv&space;Max[&space;E_{image}]\\\equiv&space;Max[\Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1}||\Delta&space;n_{\sigma}*I(v_i)||^2]]" title="\equiv Max[ E_{image}]\\\equiv Max[\Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1}||\Delta n_{\sigma}*I(v_i)||^2]]" /><br />
Currently the function `def contour()` are giving the next results:<br />

![](images/images_readme/contour.png)<br />

So we have to add some constrains and start reaching the optimal contour for the CSS-maping
