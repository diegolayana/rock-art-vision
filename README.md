# Rock Art Vision

Computer vision 👁️ program for Rock Art analysis. 

## Introduction

_This program is part of my work to obtain Electronic Engieneering degree._🤕

I'm this work, a methodology for the orgaization and analisys of rock art data from Arica y Parinacota region is being proposed. 
Workig with drawings from this artifeacts a curvature analisys is being development for a automatic classification.
Also, manim animations is beign studied for visualization porpuses during the final presentation.

## Progress
The following list is the composition of the code and its progress: 

_this list is going to be updated everyday (i wish)_

Simbology: ✅ = Ready, ☑️ = In progress, ⌚ = In waiting

* Automatic Classification: ☑️
  * Preprocessing: ✅
    * Thresholding. ✅
    * Resizing. ✅
    * First moment of area. _(getting the center)_ ✅
    * Second moment of area. _(getting the orientation)_ ✅
    * Initialization. ✅

  * Segmentation: ☑️
    * Control points.✅
    * Contour lines.✅
      * Greedy algorithm. ✅
      * Active contour model.☑️
    * Initialization. ⌚

  * Curvature Scale Space mapping (CSS-map): ☑️
    * Contour initializacion. ☑️
    * -the rest of the code- ⌚

  * Support Vector Machine algorithm (SVM): ⌚
  
* Visualization: ⌚
